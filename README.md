# Warden Loot <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/600335615409782796/986564881195102218/sculk_chestplate.gif" align="right" width="160"/>

A fabric mod that adds very powerful (and very hard to get) weapons and armor, themed around the Warden and the Ancient City

## Obtaining Items
The intended way to obtain the items in this mod is to kill The Warden (hence the name), but it is possible to obtain everything without killing The Warden

### Imbued Ingot
**Imbued Ingots** can be rarely found in chests in the Ancient City, or can be crafted by surrounding an Iron Ingot on four sides with **Consumed Souls**, which can be obtained in three ways:
- Killing The Warden (Drops many)
- Looting an Ancient City chest (Rare)
- Mining a Sculk block (Very rare)
-

**Imbued Ingots** can be combined with Netherite tools to make **Imbued Tools**

### Warden Heart
A **Warden Heart** can be obtained in two ways:
- Killing The Warden (Always drops one)
- Surrounding a diamond with four **Imbued Ingots** and four Echo Shards
-

**Warden Hearts** can be combined with Netherite armor to make the **Depth-Keeper's Armor Set**

Wearing the full **Depth-Keeper's Armor Set** will make The Warden fear you.
